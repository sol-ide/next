<h1>xsldbg Installation for RISC OS</h1>

<p>
You will require :
<ul>
<li>LibXML2 2.4.12 or greater
<li>LibXSLT 1.0.9 or greater
<li>xsldbg 0.9.5 or greater
<li>Norcroft C compiler (LCC, or GCC may suffice but has not been tested)
<li>A file system that supports long file names, for example RISC OS 4 E+
    formatted discs, or a third party system such as raFS.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The LibXML2, LibXSLT and xsldbg source can be obtained from
<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/justin.fletcher/XML/">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/justin.fletcher/XML/</a>. For ease, your directory structure
should appear thus :
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
<tr>
 <td colspan="6" align="center">XMLTools</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td colspan="2" align="center">libxml2-2/4/12</td>
 <td colspan="2" align="center">libxslt-1/0/9</td>
 <td colspan="2" align="center">xsldbg-0/9/5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td align="center">Original</td>
 <td align="center">RISCOS</td>
 <td align="center">Original</td>
 <td align="center">RISCOS</td>
 <td align="center">Original</td>
 <td align="center">RISCOS</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The 'RISCOS' directories should contain the source for each relevant
library. Where the version of the source differs, the directory names should
also be modified. Whilst the original source is not required, the structure
allows the source to be held alongside the RISC OS specific version.
</p>

<h2>Building LibXML2</h2>
<p>To build LibXML2, you should :
<ul>
<li>Build the executables and libraries by invoking amu on the command line
    (<tt>*amu</tt> will suffice).
<li>Copy the xmllint and xmlcatalog executables into your library. Under
    RISC OS Select, these will live in the XML sub-group. You will need to
    create the XML group yourself as it is not present in the standard
    distribution.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Building LibXSLT</h2>
<p>To build LibXSLT, you should :
<ul>
<li>Update the Makefile to contain the correct verion of LibXML that you
    will compile and link against. The variable <tt>LIBXML2_VERSION</tt>
    should be set to the correct value.
<li>Build the executables and libraries by invoking amu on the command line
    (<tt>*amu</tt> will suffice).
<li>Copy the xsltproc executable into your library. Under RISC OS Select,
    this will live in the XML sub-group. You will need to
    create the XML group yourself as it is not present in the standard
    distribution.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Building XSLDebug</h2>
<p>To build xsldebug, you should :
<ul>
<li>Update the Makefile to contain the correct verion of LibXML and LibXSLT
    that you will compile and link against. The variables
    <tt>LIBXML2_VERSION</tt> and <tt>LIBXSLT_VERSION</tt> should be set to
    the correct value.
<li>Build the executables and libraries by invoking amu on the command line
    (<tt>*amu</tt> will suffice).
<li>Copy the xsldebug executable into your library. Under RISC OS Select,
    this will live in the XML sub-group. You will need to
    create the XML group yourself as it is not present in the standard
    distribution.
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Using XSLDebug</h1>
<p>Like the other XML tools, XSLDebug expects its filename parameters to be
passed as unix-like filenames relative to the current directory, or as file:
URIs. With this exception, the tool should fundamentally work in exactly the
same manner to the unix version.
